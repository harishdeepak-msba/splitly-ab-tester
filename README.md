## 🌐 Live App

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **Frontend (App)** | https://splitly-frontend.onrender.com |
| **Backend (API)** | https://splitly-backend-hgac.onrender.com |

> **Note:** Hosted on Render free tier — the backend may take ~30 seconds to wake up on first visit after a period of inactivity. The 3 O&G demo experiments auto-load on startup.

---

## 🚀 Live Demo Scenarios (Oil & Gas Industry)

The app ships with three pre-built Oil & Gas demo experiments:

| # | Experiment | Scenario | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Safety Training Portal | Video modules vs Text manuals | **Video wins +100%** (7.1% → 14.2% completion) |
| 2 | Field Service Request Form | 5-field form vs 12-field form | **Inconclusive** — need more data |
| 3 | Equipment Maintenance Alert | Push notification vs Email alert | **Push loses** (8.7% → 5.2% acknowledgement) |

## What is A/B Testing?

A/B testing (also called split testing) is a method of comparing two versions of something to determine which one performs better. Instead of guessing which design, headline, or layout works best, you show Version A to half your visitors and Version B to the other half — then measure which version gets more people to take the desired action.

**Example:** You want to know if a red button gets more clicks than a blue one. You split your traffic 50/50, collect data for two weeks, and let the statistics tell you which button is better — with 95% confidence.

**Terminal 1 — Backend API (port 3001)**
```bash
cd ABTester/backend
npm install
node src/index.js
```

**Terminal 2 — Frontend (port 3000)**
```bash
cd ABTester/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open **http://localhost:3000** in your browser.

## 📖 How to Use

### Step 1 — Load Demo Scenarios
On first visit, click **"See Live Oil & Gas Examples"** to instantly load 3 pre-built experiments with realistic data. This is the fastest way to explore the platform.

### Step 2 — Create Your Own Experiment
1. Click **New Experiment**
2. **Step 1 of 2:** Enter a name, hypothesis, and conversion goal
   - Use the O&G suggestion panel to auto-fill with industry examples
3. **Step 2 of 2:** Configure your variants (Control vs Variant B)
   - Set traffic splits (must add up to 100%)
   - Describe what's different about each variant
4. Click **Create Experiment**

### Step 3 — Start and Track
1. On the experiment detail page, click **Start Experiment**
2. Click **Get Snippet** to copy the JavaScript tracking code
3. Paste the snippet into your website (see [Tracking Snippet](#tracking-snippet))

### Step 4 — Read Results
- Wait until you have **100+ visitors per variant**
- Check the **Confidence** column — act only when it reaches **95%+**
- A green **Winner** banner appears when results are statistically significant
- The **"What to do next"** panel at the top guides every decision

### Step 5 — Make a Decision
| Result | Action |
|---|---|
| 🏆 Significant Win | Implement the winning variant. Mark experiment Complete. |
| 📉 Significant Loss | Keep Control. Discard the variant. |
| ⏳ Not Significant | Keep running, or try a more dramatic difference between variants. |

## 🔌 Tracking Snippet

Add this to any webpage you want to test:

```html
<!-- Load Splitly tracker -->
<script src="http://your-server.com/snippet.js"></script>

<script>
  // Assign visitor to a variant (call once per page load)
  Splitly.assign('YOUR_EXPERIMENT_ID', function(assignment) {
    console.log('Assigned to:', assignment.variantName);

    if (assignment.variantName === 'Control (Original)') {
      // Show original version
    } else {
      // Show new variant
    }
  });

  // Call this when the user completes the goal
  function onGoalCompleted() {
    Splitly.convert('YOUR_EXPERIMENT_ID');
  }
</script>
```

**How it works under the hood:**
- Each visitor is randomly assigned to a variant based on traffic split percentages
- The assignment is stored in `localStorage` so the same visitor always sees the same variant
- Impressions are tracked automatically on `Splitly.assign()`
- Conversions are tracked when you call `Splitly.convert()`
- One conversion per session is enforced to prevent duplicates

## ⛽ Oil & Gas Use Cases

A/B testing is widely applicable across Oil & Gas digital operations:

| Area | What to Test | Metric |
|---|---|---|
| **HSE Portals** | Video training vs PDF manuals | Completion rate |
| **Field Apps** | Short form vs detailed form | Submission rate |
| **Maintenance Systems** | Push alert vs email alert | Acknowledgement time |
| **Vendor Portals** | Cost-savings headline vs reliability headline | RFQ submission rate |
| **Inspection Apps** | Mobile-first checklist vs desktop form | Compliance rate |
| **Recruitment Pages** | Safety culture emphasis vs compensation emphasis | Applications submitted |
| **Procurement Dashboards** | Card layout vs table layout | Time to decision |
| **Incident Reporting** | Anonymous reporting vs named reporting | Report volume |

**Why it matters:** In a company with 5,000 field workers, improving safety training completion from 7% to 14% means 350 more workers completing critical safety content — a measurable operational safety improvement driven by data.

## 📊 Statistical Method

Splitly uses a **two-proportion Z-test** to determine statistical significance.

### How it works

Given:
- Control: `n₁` visitors, `c₁` conversions → rate `p₁ = c₁/n₁`
- Variant: `n₂` visitors, `c₂` conversions → rate `p₂ = c₂/n₂`

**Pooled proportion:**
```
p = (c₁ + c₂) / (n₁ + n₂)
```

**Z-score:**
```
Z = (p₂ - p₁) / √(p × (1-p) × (1/n₁ + 1/n₂))
```

**P-value** (two-tailed):
```
p-value = 2 × (1 - Φ(|Z|))
```

**Confidence level:**
```
confidence = (1 - p-value) × 100%
```

A result is declared **statistically significant** when `p-value < 0.05` (confidence ≥ 95%), meaning there is less than a 5% chance the observed difference is due to random chance.

### Minimum sample size
For reliable results, aim for at least **100 visitors per variant** before drawing conclusions. Smaller samples produce unstable estimates.
